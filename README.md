# FYP-Spark-Frontend

Big data analytics has become pervasive in modern society. Data analytic engines, such as Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop, provide essential facilities for performing a wide range of analysis on various types of data. However, each analysis generally requires programming on data in an ad-hoc manner. This is a non-negligible barrier for general users, without programming skills, to approach big data analysis. In this project, we aim to provide a MS Excel-like frontend for Apache Spark, so that operations performed in this frontend are transparently translated into a set of Spark operations. The initial implementation of the frontend may include several basic functions, such as, Max, Min, Avg, Sort, etc., and employ data display schemes that are similar to MS Excel.
